gWell I wasn’t expecting that to happen.

<div></div><div>I thought I’d try the fon 2.0n openwrt build environment on it as they are similar chips, anways  I messed around with kernel configs abit and seemed I broke something so I had to manually select setting, so I picked rt3050 options and proper memory size an hey presto a stock fon2.0n flashed fine :O</div><div>wifi and usb all seem to work, next is how to remove all the fon branding etc. but for now I can start writing my data logging software now yay!</div><div>With a bit of fat cut out the firmware I bet this would work on other edimax stuff  like the 3g-6200n and maybe even the 36-6200nl?</div><div></div>

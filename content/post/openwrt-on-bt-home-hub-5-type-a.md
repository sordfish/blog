I've been looking for a low cost solution to get better wifi coverage at home.

After looking at wifi repeaters and their cost (£20 - £40) I set out to see if it can be done better and on a budget.

For best performance I was looking for hardware that had dual radios, 5.8ghz coverage and was openwrt compatible.

I had first thought about using one of the portable tp-link routers but they didn't seem to have the features I needed. 

I then consulted the openwrt hardware list and spotted the BT Home Hub 5 (type A) listed. This router was given free as part of BT's infinity package so I figured ebay would be inundated with them.

A quick search on eBay bagged me on for £8 delivered.

I've been using a Samsung SmartThings v2 Hub for about two years now but before it goes the way of the DoDo or [a surprise subscription](https://hackaday.com/2020/05/07/ask-hackaday-wink-hubs-extortion-as-a-service/) appears out of nowhere that I'm forced to use as I've invested too much in custom rules.

Anyway, I've set out to find a replacement hub that will work with Home Assistant and isn't reliant on "The Cloud" and runs an open source OS, Ideally Linux.

The Contenders
-----

- Keep the SmartThings V2 hub and try hacking a Custom OS
- The same but for the V3 hub
- Hack a Hive Nano Hub v2 to run Linux
- Don't bother and just add USB Zigbee dongle to a Pi and run USB over TCP/IP?
- Itead Sonoff Zigbee Hub
- Something Else?

Well as it's me I'm going to probably try everything on the list at some point :D

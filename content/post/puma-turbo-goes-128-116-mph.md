My good friend Lewis has shoehorned a Zetec turbo into a Ford Puma.

Iâ€™ve done all the wiring on the car including fitting and mapping a Megasquirt ecu.

It went to pod last weekend (17/04) and managed a best time of 12.8 on its first outing!

It's still on stock suspension so there is plenty of potential left and still needs dyno time.

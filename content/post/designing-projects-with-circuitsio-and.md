Iâ€™ve been wanting to get into designing my own boards for projects and decided to give a cloud based system a go.

The idea is great but both systens are still very beta, lack of manuals and lots of crashing has put me off.

hopefully I can export my project and just bite the bullet with kicad. maybe it will take off in 12 months time.

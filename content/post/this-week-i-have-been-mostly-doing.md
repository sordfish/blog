Very little.

<div></div><div>My pos Civic is back in its spot on the drive! Hopefully once I get it running (only need to fit the tank, battery and finish up the loom). I’ve also order a 128×64 glcd to replace the temp and fuel gauge and try to pull data from the stock ecu.</div><div><div>My sample order from microchip finally came so I can start messing around with my arduino and canbus. been trying to find examples how to use it but they all seem to use a lib that some German guy wrote and at the moment its way over my head :S. </div><div></div><div>Also managed to start some py cairo stuff have worked out how to draw a circle that resembles a gauge.</div><div><div></div><div></div></div></div>

Another STM32 Iâ€™ve had for years is the Liveview.

A few clever people on the XDA developers forum have reverse engineered the device and made drivers for chibios.

The code is on github here â€”->Â [https://github.com/GottZ/olvfw](https://github.com/GottZ/olvfw)Â  FYI this is not my code!!

Itâ€™s old code but Iâ€™ve compiled it my self and flashed it and it works!

And yes Iâ€™ll be getting canbus working via the micro usb port at some point Â ðŸ™‚

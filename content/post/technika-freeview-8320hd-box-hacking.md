I’ve had this sat on a shelf for a few years in the hope I can one day get root on this device and have it multicast the dvb-t2 streams over the network.

I’ve crawled the internet to find what info is about for this and there doesn’t seem to be a publicly know way to get root.

My first port of call is to removed the BGA flash chip and try and read this with some sort of DIY nand reader.

After playing with my Nokia 770, and getting pissed off with python I’ve gone back to making an Arduino display data on 20×4 lcd.

I’m a noob at coding with an Arduino but I’m finding it easier to pick up and I’ve managed to get it working pretty reasonably.

I’ve bought some parts from bobsbits.co.uk to make an arduino shield for my lcd and fit it all in my project box, as its spaghetti at the moment.

I’ve also requested some samples canbus chips. the idea is have it connect to the canbus stream of the megasquirt2 & 3 and possibly other devices like, Honda obd0, OMEX, innovate, plx etc.

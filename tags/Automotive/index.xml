The tl;dr seems to be that a few have tried but came up against a possible hardware bug making it practically useless. I&amp;rsquo;ve even asked on the TI forums for example code but they don&amp;rsquo;t have any.
My aim for this ECU is to have a fully open source, highly versatile and precise base to be used on affordable hardware.</description></item></channel></rss>

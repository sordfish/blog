I shall start posting again soon, and I have a few things I shall be posting about such as;</p><ul><li><p>**Olimexino **– was looking for cheap dev boards with canbus and found this, its based on the maple which is like an Arduino but on speed. Managed to get it to write stuff to an sd card so should have a post about a Megasquirt logger at some point.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sony Ericsson Live view</strong> – Got one for xmas and the novelty wore off after about a day, mainly due to it dropping connection to my phone, which it gets time data from so its not even good at being a watch. There is a thread on XDA trying to hack it to make it better but seems dead in the water. Strangely enough it has the same processor as the Olimexino so I’m semi familiar to it, so hopefully I can re purpose it for greater things.</p></li><li><p><strong>Galaxy S2</strong> – No idea, great phone but I would like to make an few apps, mainly to work with megasquirt. The Tunerstudio dude is making apps but they will probably turn into beggar ware to so a nice open logger would be a good project.</p></li><li><p>**My Car/ Megasquirt **– Now my relationship with megaturd as it is now known is a love hate one. I love the flexibility but the hardware is shit the licence is shit and tunerstudio is beggerware, I’m sick of the db37 and the mess you have to make if you want to do any adjustments or use decent guage wire. Jean has made a nice microsquirt style ecu but its expensive for what it does. Fingers crossed there’s an MS3 based microsquirt or they get Quoriva working.  or dare i say it FreeEMS get it act together and gets stable hardware and missing tooth code working. I know theres plenty of off the shelf ecus that just work, but I know ms and for the cost nothing touches it. so you may see some post about custom boards etc for the module but I’m not sure yet.</p></li></ul><div>well thats about it for now.</div><div></div></div><div class="post_extra mb-2"><div class=copy data-before="Share Story" data-after="Link Copied"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="#copy"/></svg></div></div><div></div></div></div><a href=https://arranshort.xyz/ class=post_nav><span class=post_next>The Latest<svg class="icon icon_scale"><use xlink:href="#double-arrow"/></svg></span></a></div></main><footer class="footer wrap pale"><p>&copy;&nbsp;<span class=year></span>&nbsp;The Adventures of Arran Short</p><p class="attribution upcase">Designed by <a href="<no value>" target=_blank title="Linkedin Profile" rel=nonopener><no value></a></p></footer><script src=https://arranshort.xyz/js/index.min.974e37b2a16b2a8475f320f64202dfd6fdb1b2758b99f3fb3612645d27f103f24a9bdae10dc80d6d52edd9b7893a2ef3ececbcaa5771e09a00e7f6d87a55b829.js></script><svg width="0" height="0" class="hidden"><symbol xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 699.428 699.428" id="copy"><path d="M502.714.0H240.428C194.178.0 153 42.425 153 87.429l-25.267.59c-46.228.0-84.019 41.834-84.019 86.838V612c0 45.004 41.179 87.428 87.429 87.428H459c46.249.0 87.428-42.424 87.428-87.428h21.857c46.25.0 87.429-42.424 87.429-87.428v-349.19L502.714.0zM459 655.715H131.143c-22.95.0-43.714-21.441-43.714-43.715V174.857c0-22.272 18.688-42.993 41.638-42.993l23.933-.721v393.429C153 569.576 194.178 612 240.428 612h262.286c0 22.273-20.765 43.715-43.714 43.715zm153-131.143c0 22.271-20.765 43.713-43.715 43.713H240.428c-22.95.0-43.714-21.441-43.714-43.713V87.429c0-22.272 20.764-43.714 43.714-43.714H459c-.351 50.337.0 87.975.0 87.975.0 45.419 40.872 86.882 87.428 86.882H612v306zm-65.572-349.715c-23.277.0-43.714-42.293-43.714-64.981V44.348L612 174.857h-65.572zm-43.714 131.537H306c-12.065.0-21.857 9.77-21.857 21.835s9.792 21.835 21.857 21.835h196.714c12.065.0 21.857-9.771 21.857-21.835.0-12.065-9.792-21.835-21.857-21.835zm0 109.176H306c-12.065.0-21.857 9.77-21.857 21.834.0 12.066 9.792 21.836 21.857 21.836h196.714c12.065.0 21.857-9.77 21.857-21.836.0-12.064-9.792-21.834-21.857-21.834z"/></symbol><symbol viewBox="0 0 53 42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" id="double-arrow"><path d="M.595 39.653a1.318 1.318.0 010-1.864L16.55 21.833a1.318 1.318.0 000-1.863L.595 4.014a1.318 1.318.0 010-1.863L2.125.62a1.318 1.318.0 011.864.0l19.35 19.349a1.318 1.318.0 010 1.863l-19.35 19.35a1.318 1.318.0 01-1.863.0zm29 0a1.318 1.318.0 010-1.864L45.55 21.833a1.318 1.318.0 000-1.863L29.595 4.014a1.318 1.318.0 010-1.863l1.53-1.53a1.318 1.318.0 011.864.0l19.35 19.349a1.318 1.318.0 010 1.863l-19.35 19.35a1.318 1.318.0 01-1.863.0z"/></symbol></svg></body></html>
